<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span><b>S</b><span>o, what is time? If you go and search in google you will
know the time of your place. If you go and find its definition in science, you
will find that it is the sequence of past, present, and future. This word is
too confusing for scientists and some researchers then aren’t it obvious for us
“THE NORMAL PEOPLE '' to think about it? Well, Einstein, Stephen Hawkings, Sir
Isaac Newton everybody has researched on time and given some theories. Do you
think animals know about time? Time is invisible, it's a prediction done by
humankind. All the creatures who exist in this world do have mass, length,
heat, energy, but do they have time? Of course, the answer is no.</span></span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: georgia;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5947dbd14f14bc4eadcd0267/1510595208450-9JFFT0J9PK3DHVFZ5UFG/time.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="534" data-original-width="800" height="244" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5947dbd14f14bc4eadcd0267/1510595208450-9JFFT0J9PK3DHVFZ5UFG/time.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg" title="image from Squarespace" width="367" /></a></span></div><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span><br /></span><span><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span><span>We all are working on time. Not only we but the whole universe is working under time although there may be some exceptions such as black holes they</span><span>&nbsp;have also passed the stage of past, present, and future, isn’t it? Being a star and forming into a nebula and at last turning into an invisible hole, don’t you think it has also passed the stage of time? Today, I have tried to inculcate some ideas about what I think of time! I hope you will enjoy it.</span></span></div><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span ><br /></span></div><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span >Many scientists say that time is the sequence of past, present, and future. But while talking about me, I literally do not agree with them! So, first of all, let me argue about it. I think that there is no past, present, or future, there is always the present. Let me give you an example so that you can better understand.</span></div><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span ><span>&nbsp;A person is hungry and is not able to find a single piece of the source of nutrition around him. He</span><span>&nbsp;remembers the last
time when he had food but he remembers it in the PRESENT STATE. After that, he
thinks of the time when he will be able to eat but that also in the PRESENT
STATE. In this example, you can clearly see that all the past and the future events
occur in the present state of the person’s mind. So, with this example we</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>can say
that all the events of our lives happen in the present state, the past is our
remembrance and the future is our thinking.</span></span></div><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span><br /></span></div><div style="color: #0e101a;"><span><span style="color: black;"><div style="color: #0e101a; text-align: center;"><br /></div></span></span></div></span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><div><div>When humankind started to approach, people started to think why day and night happen, and slowly they started to distribute their life into three parts: past, present, and future which is solely divided into seconds, minutes, hours, days, and started to work according to it. For example: Now I am writing this article (if you call it so) on 2nd September 2020. Here I stated the time in three units i.e. day, month, and year. Slowly and gradually, we started to adopt the practices and inventions of our ancestors and we also adopted the system of the time.</div><div>&nbsp;<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/06080627/pexels-photo-TIME-677x1024.jpeg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="529" height="394" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/06080627/pexels-photo-TIME-677x1024.jpeg" width="261" /></a></div></div><div>Now, everywhere we go, we talk about time. We conduct meetings according to the time, we eat according to the time, sleep according to the time, and do accordingly with our daily life activities. If we become two minutes late for any class then the teacher scolds us. If we do not wake up according to the time we will miss many appointments, meetings, and many more. To make our life systematic and easier, we make a timetable all including the minutes, hours, and seconds. If we do not follow the time, we will ruin our life because our life works according to the plans we make and the plans depend upon the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;As we know time waits for none. So, where is the time? If we start to search the time, probably the time will kill us (We will slowly become old and die). So, isn’t the time ruling us? Because if time leaves us, we will freeze and if time is there and we don’t follow the rules made under it, our life will go in vain! The most challenging job in the whole universe is to defeat time which nobody containing mass can do.</div><div><br /></div><div>What do you think the time is then? Although we cannot see it, it has been keeping everything under its control. Time is an invisible ruler. Please share your views with me by commenting below. Thank you!!</div></div></span></span></span>
