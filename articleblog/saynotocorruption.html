<p><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">C</span></b>or</span><span>ruption is an act of misusing the power of authority by any public servant or maybe private too! Corruption is also called white-collar crime sometimes. White-collar workers are those which do their work sitting on a table, desk and mainly in computers or with papers. In simple words, they do not do manual labor and are more qualified than laborers i.e. they are the educated manpower of a nation. This crime is often found committed by these types of people so, it is also called white-collar crime.</span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2017/miscellaneous/Niranjan-Mani-Dixit-22092017075935.jpg&amp;w=900&amp;height=601" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><img alt="corruption image" border="0" data-original-height="457" data-original-width="800" height="238" src="https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2017/miscellaneous/Niranjan-Mani-Dixit-22092017075935.jpg&amp;w=900&amp;height=601" title="Image from google" width="416" /></span></a></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Corruption is a huge social problem in any country in the world. All the development activities get stopped by this only. There are many causes of corruption. For example Lack of enough money or want for a luxurious lifestyle, extravagance spending, a monopoly in the market, etc. If any person does not have enough money for a living then he/she will commit corruption and involvement in bribery, nepotism, etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br />Now, let's move through its types. So, how can corruption be categorized? Corruption can be categorized into various groups. Such as Nepotism, Bribery, Embezzlement of public wealth, Favoritism, and many more. These all contribute towards the birth of corruption in any country. Moreover, these forms of corruption harm the public wealth, and slow down the pace of development in the country, it will defy meritocracy i.e. choosing/ selecting based on merit. In this way, corruption may have many forms which may also have harmful effects.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS3_GBHB5B6A7bF_kHB9Kx3OiXK1FcYiJAs1w&amp;usqp=CAU" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><img border="0" data-original-height="109" data-original-width="460" height="121" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS3_GBHB5B6A7bF_kHB9Kx3OiXK1FcYiJAs1w&amp;usqp=CAU" width="375" /></span></a></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">How to minimize corruption in any country? So, for that, we should organize different awareness programs in the rural parts of our country about corruption. Not only that, but we should also boycott the professionals involved in corruption and also increase the level of self-motivation and self-confidence. We should make international and national organizations working for corruption control more effectively. Also, we can implement strict laws in our country after formulating them. This much for today. Hope you got the main gist of this article!!</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">So, I would like to request all of those involved in corruption to stop it and for those who are not involved to aware other about the harmful effects of corruption in any country. Thank you!!!</span></p></span>
