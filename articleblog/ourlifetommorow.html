There is no sign of clean rivers, people are starving for food and water, the clouds have stopped to rain because they are unable to be born. The big layer of waste in the oceans and seas has blocked all the water animals and they are dying of oxygen. People are killing themselves for food. The so-called high-class people and the rich people are unable to buy anything for their living as there are no industries present.</span></span></div><div class="separator"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: medium; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;">All the natural resources have been destroyed and there is no sign of trees on the whole earth. The Antarctic continent has melted and the sea level is rising by 5m each day. All the bacteria and viruses present underneath the icecaps are free and are harming all the animals and the people. People are suffering from different types of diseases. Famine, drought, unemployment, poverty, murder, etc. have been common around the people. All those animals are unable to adapt themselves to the heated surrounding and are dying day by day. The plants are dying of food as they are unable to get water and proper light for their living. Global warming and climate change both are stopped as people are not being able to use the sources of the harmful gases that cause them to happen. Climate change occurred in the past by the excessive use of fossil fuels has increased the temperature of the Earth.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator"><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;"><br /></span></div><div><div style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-size: medium;"><img height="286" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7mCjYJQOrQJ6KBIqq8oxLpdfN0j6SDjRV12428lEP-nYqgERd8ARb0mNlOCpjw-MX_WjSJCl8pjpF40l3aMmkJ_0IcWBAB6CTH70klcTXprEBqEpqDvJ1MkhudTX_lImyE4GLbyz=w320-h286" style="font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap;" width="320" /></span></div><div><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; white-space: pre-wrap;">All the systems of practicing different types of occupations are lost because humans have realized that money cannot do anything now as food cannot be obtained from them. All the people have become wild and there is no sense of relation, mutual cooperation, friendship among themselves. There is the occurrence of frequent landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, etc in different parts of the world. Reproduction in the organisms has stopped as they don't have proper conditions for living. The sudden increase in sea level has caused tsunamis and hurricanes. Slowly and gradually people's population is decreasing due to numerous attacks, suicidal attempts, natural disasters, and plenty more. People are turning nomadic and the barbarian age has started.</span></div><div><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: medium; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div><div><div style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="color: #20124d; font-size: medium;"><img height="194" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WssP7citgIeLd7lHwD5mYGo_ecK9yuCr6uBdQifgSxspfh6RmCFKpJp7m6sbJc9KFccV4OGxCwhinQc0Bk1mmfMkb537vkQqXB02z-7avPBxJmU57GaH_-UzOpH7lpvngSEn-kHb=w320-h194" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" width="320" /></span></div><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;;">So, this is how our earth might be in the future. To prevent this, we should ban deforestation in every country. People should have proper waste management in their homes. All the pipelines that are connected with our toilets, industries, etc. should be cut and a proper alternative can be used instead of them. We should not use plastics in our country. The use of fossil fuels should be banned in each and every country in the world. People should use eco-friendly products in their homes. Letâ€™s make our earth green and beautiful earth.</span></div><div><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #20124d; font-family: verdana;">If you loved this article then don't hesitate to share this to your friends so that they all are aware about it.
