<article><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Our life is full of pain and pleasure. Sometimes, we laugh, sometimes we cry. All the parents of the world keep their children away from the worldly pains but fill them with pleasures instead. I am telling this because I have experienced it myself&nbsp; (as a child). In the children phase of life, we are not known about the feeling of hatred, jealousy, the habit of speaking untruth, etc. Slowly, when we start to develop when we are known to the laws of the society, our parents start to share some of the tensions that they have, the frightening moments of their lives, the pains they have, according to the capacity our mind can bear. When we grow adult, we start to face them one by one. This is the law of nature.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.successconsciousness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/happiness-ballons.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="clear: left; float: left; font-family: georgia; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="373" data-original-width="570" height="246" src="https://cdn.successconsciousness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/happiness-ballons.jpg" width="338" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Pleasure is the state of happiness that is achieved through satisfaction. Not everyone in this world experience an only pleasure. Some people might say rich people experience, but let me tell you one thing, rich people are those who are always worried about their money. They think someone will steal it. Pain is the state of discomfort caused due to troubles and tensions. Every people in this world do not only experience pain. Even though someone has suffered a lot in his/ her life, there will be some state in his/ her life that will make her happy (whether it for a short-term or for a long-term).&nbsp;</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQXqDTgJy7pJEcamVcOW4vJrptMWDnmsSavSA&amp;usqp=CAU" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="clear: left; float: left; font-family: georgia; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="207" data-original-width="244" height="246" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQXqDTgJy7pJEcamVcOW4vJrptMWDnmsSavSA&amp;usqp=CAU" width="298" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Our parents sacrifice a lot for us. Giving birth to a new life and protecting it from invisible walls by guarding outside the walls taking all the tensions and troubles all over themselves is a very tough task. They are the ones who are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of seeing happiness in their children. They work several hours a day and earn money. We, the children, take about 75% of their money in education, food, house, clothes, etc. On top of that, we demand a lot of things which are fulfilled by them although they are not affordable. In this way, our parents give us happiness when we are children.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Later on, when we start to grow up, we slowly start to learn about the struggles, sacrifices, tensions, troubles, etc faced by our parents and other adults. We learn to cope up with them using the strategies our parents have applied and slowly get exposed to all the worldly pains. We learn to; lie, express sympathy towards others, feel jealous, take care, feel embarrassed in front of girls, adults, etc. in this stage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">This wheel of life is constant, everybody has to experience this. Everybody has to face pains and pleasures in their life. We just need to cope up with them, face them. Therefore, this is the law of nature.</span></p></article>
