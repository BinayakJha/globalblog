We, humans, were not distributed in different regions or religions in the past. Likewise, we were also not divided into other countries and continents. Gradually, people started to be greedy in terms of food, selfishness, and ruler. People began to have different opinions regarding the same subject. Therefore, we divided into various societies.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QVObRkzd-hI/X5FuAt-UGuI/AAAAAAAAARM/AYkLWVpwtXISREsmrGe9MAfqWcJGLNVpACLcBGAsYHQ/s1286/pangaea.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Before and after Earth Image" border="0" data-original-height="726" data-original-width="1286" height="181" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QVObRkzd-hI/X5FuAt-UGuI/AAAAAAAAARM/AYkLWVpwtXISREsmrGe9MAfqWcJGLNVpACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h181/pangaea.jpg" title="Image from Goggle" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: georgia;">You know, in the past, the earth did not have distributed land i.e. it did not have seven continents, all of the continents were joined which was named Pangaea. Pangaea was also termed as a supercontinent as it was the combination of all the seven continents. Due to natural forces, Pangaea got separated into different parts which are now termed as continents. These continents have plates underneath them. Some plates are thicker whereas some are thinner. Sometimes these plates collide with each other which forms volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and many more. It causes a lot of damage to nature as well as humankind.</span><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ8150Zl0XL2MuIrAt9geUTnmGOE9_VFAbIlg&amp;usqp=CAU" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><img alt="War Victory image" border="0" data-original-height="183" data-original-width="276" height="210" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ8150Zl0XL2MuIrAt9geUTnmGOE9_VFAbIlg&amp;usqp=CAU" title="Image from Google" width="317" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-d156cea3-7fff-8d46-ca2d-82ae69a15ab4"><span style="font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span>Now, let's compare this example with us the superiors i.e. HUMANS. We also originated from the same place. We started to form different groups and each group had a different rule, regulation, shelter. But before that, we were united. We used to fight together to kill animals. The women used to go together in the jungle to collect wild berries and fruits. But remember it happened only when we were civilized. As time passed, we started to develop a feeling of hatred, jealousy, ownership, etc. towards each other. This led to the formation of races, castes, religions, etc. People started to discriminate against each other in terms of color, caste, creed, and many more. Now, we have different countries. We are spread to the whole earth just as the continents. In the same way, we also fight among each other(countries) just like those plates for power, territory, wealth, etc. This disrupts mother nature as well as humankind.</span></span></span><br /></span><p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/deforestation-logging-cut-forests.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><img alt="Deforestation Image" border="0" data-original-height="489" data-original-width="728" height="246" src="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/deforestation-logging-cut-forests.jpg" title="Image From Google" width="366" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: georgia;">Every year we cut thousands and lakhs of trees, for our benefit. We use nature. Similarly, nature also uses us to balance itself. Sometimes, when we have a growing population, nature becomes angry and kills us using natural disasters. However, it doesn't succeed in maintaining balance in the environment even after doing those. So, during that period, it uses other things in the surroundings to kill us like viruses, animals, plants, etc. So, this is the relation between us. To maintain this we need to practice sustainable developmental activities, we need to organize health and population awareness programs.&nbsp;</span><p></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">My request to all of those who belong to humankind is that let's maintain the balance between nature and us healthily. It would give birth to new earth where we would have eco-friendly products used along with a zero pollution environment. This would make all of us happy i.e. nature and us and all the natural components. Let's not fight with each other and become united just like the Pangaea. Let's maintain unity, peace, and cooperation in our society.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Thank you!!</span></p></span>
