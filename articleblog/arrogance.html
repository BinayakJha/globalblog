<span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;">F</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt;">irst of all, let me define arrogance. The state of a person in which his/her mind starts to think himself/herself more strong than other people in terms of different sectors and feels excessively proud about the strong quality he/she has more than the other is called arrogance.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jl4Vx5a_TtfHO-d1xrYd9kFsyja55Pt5isqf2Z3BSchuECYKGf5wbWmxr0ev6-6a9DXP4wA=s128" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><img border="0" data-original-height="533" data-original-width="800" height="195" src="../images/arrogance.jpg" width="339" /></span></a></div><span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Now, what about capacity? Capacity Is the state in which a person is unable to compete with another person in terms of many sectors (mostly wealthy). For example: Taking any two people, if the first person is too rich whereas the other is poor then the poor person is unable to compete or compare himself/herself with the rich person which is called the capacity of the person.
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">On the other hand, bigotry is one's state in which a person becomes intolerant with the other if his/her opinion does not match with the opinions of the other person. In simple words, bigotry can also be called discrimination which usually happens because the capacity of a person does not match with the other.
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
Now, let’s talk about the relationship between these three terms. Talking about it in simple terms, if the capacity of a person does not match with the capacity of the other person he/she becomes arrogant of the superior quality he/she has compared to the person with the low capacity. Arrogance gives birth to bigotry. People start to discriminate against each other and this decreases unity among the people. Let's talk about it with a simple example: There are two people in a village, both belonging to the Middle-Class Family, during that time. Slowly and gradually, one person started to progress a lot and earn a huge amount of money making him rich. Now, the old relation between these people will change because the rich person will feel arrogant about his large capacity and the other person will also feel jealous of his progress. This will bring discrimination between them which will divide them into two different parts making each of them their enemy.</span></p></span></span><span id="docs-internal-guid-34774b15-7fff-5f1c-f38b-1a9cbe3941c6"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bigotry-negative-aspect-life-symbolized-600w-1834546921.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center; white-space: normal;"><img border="0" data-original-height="358" data-original-width="600" height="277" src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bigotry-negative-aspect-life-symbolized-600w-1834546921.jpg" width="464" /></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, now let’s come to the main point, let’s compare the given example with the whole of humankind. At first, all the people belonged to the same group. Slowly after the advancement of humankind, some people started to progress a lot whereas some progressed less. Thus, the difference between these people increased biases, arrogance, jealousy, and above all bigotry between them. This resulted in the distribution of people among different countries and places with the disappearance of unity and the appearance of disunity and war. According to the capacity of different people in different sectors, people were distributed into castes, creed, color, religion, and many more. All of these happened because of Arrogance, Bigotry, and Capacity!! (ABC).</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Don’t you think so!
